# Cuts a release: bumps the version, commits, tags "v<version>", and with --push
# pushes branch + tag — which triggers .github/workflows/release.yml to build,
# package (.zip + .dmg), and publish the GitHub Release. CI derives the released
# version from the tag, so the tag is the source of truth — this just keeps the
# committed CFBundleShortVersionString and the README version line in step so
# *local/dev* builds report the same number.
#
#   scripts/release.sh 1.3.0          # bump Info.plist + README, commit, tag v1.3.0
#   scripts/release.sh 1.3.0 --push   # …also push the commit + tag (CI then publishes)
#   scripts/release.sh                # tag the current version as-is
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh [X.Y[.Z]] [--push]
# Shared engine: https://github.com/L-K-M/release-tool (this stub only sets config).
# The plist kind edits Info.plist via /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy — run on macOS.
